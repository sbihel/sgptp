# SGM - TP4 (Louis BÃ©ziaud & Simon Bihel)

Some Nachos related errors where fixed [[#3], [#4], [#5], [#6], [#9], [#10], [#11], [#12], [#13]].

We had troubles due to an error with our SGP base code [[#16]].

We note that debugging virtual memory errors is difficult, as standard tools (such as valgrind), do not help [[#14], [#18], [#19]].

We tested our code with combinations of two threaded *producer / consumer* (`test/prodcons.c`, `test/prodcons2.c`), a racing *producer / consumer* (`test/ab.c`) and `shell`. Launching tests inside multiple "layers" of `shell` was the main difficulty.

The code is now fully working.
