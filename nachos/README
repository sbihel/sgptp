This directory contains the source code and documentation
of the Nachos instructional operating system. Nachos was
designed by the University of Berkeley (see kernel/copyright.h
for copyright information). This version of Nachos is a modified
version of Nachos made at the university of Rennes.

Enhancements compared to the Berkeley Nachos (reverse chronological order):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- all constants in upper case + consistency in method names (still partial)
- embedded documentation through the use of doxygen
- reorganisation of the source code
- addition of an ACIA device and ACIA device driver
- addition of a MMU (linear page tables)
- modification of the Nachos statistics module (finer decomposition of
  the execution time of instructions, management of stats on a 
  per-program basis)
- addition of a simplified libc for Nachos (string routines essentially)
- addition of a configuration file so that the hardware and software
  configuration of Nachos can be changed without recompiling it
  (memory size, initial file system contents, ...)
- extension of the file system to support large files and extensible files
- new roadmap to Nachos and new assigments (written in french only, but
  if you have time to translate it in english, feel free to do it)
- use of portable code for kernel context switch (using u_contexts)
- addition of system calls (thread management, error management)
- floating point arithmetic for the MIPS user programs
- new process object that aggregates an address space and a set of
  threads
- ELF32 binary file format for the MIPS user programs, instead of noff

Parts of the source code was intentionnaly cut at the places that must
be designed filled-in the assigments. The complete source code is available
on demand (for teachers only :-)
